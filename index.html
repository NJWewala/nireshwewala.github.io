								<p>
									Born and raised on a little island called Sri Lanka. I've spent 20 years of my life there but I decided to pursue a post secondary education as there is more to learn everyday in our life. I had the privilege to use a computer when I was young, eventhough it was used to play video games I was fascinated by it. I decided to pursue something related to computers, learning about hardware was fascinating but it was not my strong suit so I decided upon the software side of it. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ottawa.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									I decided to move abroad as it offers different perspectives and planned my move to Canada. After planning where to go I decided to apply for a university in Ottawa and I got accepted to Carleton University to follow a bachelors in Computer Science. </p>
									By the way, check out my <a href="#projects">awesome school projects</a>.
